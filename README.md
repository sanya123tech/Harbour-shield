# Harbour Shield
### Personal Project

<p>

- Developed a port surveillance application using machine learning and Android Studio to prevent illegal activities and ensure protocol adherence.
- Implemented ship tracking features utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning algorithm for accurate object detection. 
- Designed and deployed intruder detection functionality using facial recognition algorithms to enhance security measures.
